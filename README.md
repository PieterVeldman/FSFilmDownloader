# FSFilmDownloader


No longer works!!!  FamilySearch asked me to descontinue the project and it no longer works due to changes in FamilySearch page code. I left the code here because it might help other people that want to interact with FamilySearch data.

This is a Chrome extension which downloads all (or a subset of) the images in a FamilySearch Microfilm with a single button click. Navigate to a Microfilm register and the extension will become available.
